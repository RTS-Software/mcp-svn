# Error Solutions in MCP SVN

## Reported Problem

The `svn_status` and `svn_log` functions were failing with error code 1, while `svn_health_check` and `svn_info` worked correctly.

### Specific Errors:
- `svn status --show-updates` failed with code 1
- `svn log --limit 15` failed with code 1

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Robust Handling of `svn_status`
- **Problem**: `--show-updates` requires access to the remote repository
- **Solution**: First try with `--show-updates`, if it fails, use only local status
- **Benefit**: The function now works even without remote connectivity

### 2. Better Error Handling
- **Improvement**: More specific error messages (now in English)
- **Detected error codes**:
  - `E155007`: Not a working copy
  - `E175002`: Connection problems
  - `E170001`: Authentication error
  - `E215004`: Too many authentication attempts (new)
  - `E155036`: Working copy locked
  - `E200030`: SQLite database error

### 3. New Diagnostic Function
- **Function**: `svn_diagnose`
- **Purpose**: Test commands individually to identify specific problems
- **Information provided**:
  - Local status (works/fails)
  - Remote status (works/fails)
  - Basic log (works/fails)
  - List of specific errors
  - Solution suggestions

### 4. New Credential Cleanup Function
- **Function**: `svn_clear_credentials`
- **Purpose**: Clear SVN credential cache to resolve E215004 errors
- **Benefit**: Solves issues when SVN has tried to authenticate too many times

### 5. Improved Parsing
- **svn log**: More robust parsing with edge case handling
- **Validation**: Better validation of empty or malformed input

## How to Use the Improvements

### 1. Run Diagnostics
```bash
# Use the new diagnostic function
svn_diagnose
```

### 2. Check System Status
```bash
# Basic health check
svn_health_check
```

### 3. Clear Credential Cache (New)
```bash
# Clear cached credentials (to resolve E215004)
svn_clear_credentials
```

### 4. Get Status (Improved)
```bash
# Now works even without remote connection
svn_status
```

## Possible Causes of the Original Errors

### 1. Connectivity Problems
- SVN repository not accessible
- Firewall or proxy blocking connections
- SVN server temporarily unavailable

### 2. Authentication Problems
- Incorrect credentials
- User without sufficient permissions
- Expired authentication session

### 3. Working Copy Problems
- Corrupt working copy
- Damaged SVN database (.svn)
- Locks from previous processes

### 4. Environment Configuration
- SVN is not in the PATH
- Incorrect environment variables
- File/directory permissions

## Recommended Solutions

### For Connectivity Problems:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try manual access to the repository
3. Check proxy/firewall configuration

### For Authentication Problems:
1. Check credentials in environment variables
2. Try manual login with SVN
3. Renew credentials if expired
4. **New:** If you see error E215004 "No more credentials or we tried too many times", use `svn_clear_credentials` to clear the credential cache

### For Working Copy Problems:
1. Run `svn cleanup`
2. Update the working copy: `svn update`
3. In extreme cases, do a fresh checkout

### For Configuration Problems:
1. Check that SVN is installed and in PATH
2. Review SVN_* environment variables
3. Check directory permissions

## Testing

The improvements include:
- Automatic fallback when remote commands fail
- More informative error messages
- Diagnostic function to identify specific problems
- More robust parsing of SVN outputs

## Compatibility

These improvements are compatible with existing versions and do not break current functionality. They only improve robustness and error handling.
